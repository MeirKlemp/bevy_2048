# bevy_2048
2048 clone created with Bevy game engine.

I made this game because I wanted to get better at Rust and learn the new engine [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
It was fun to make this game and I learned a lot about Rust and Bevy.
I think Bevy has a lot of potentials, and it's now one of my favorite game engines.
